# BuzzBid 

# Description:
A database application named BuzzBdi integrates MySQL and Flask for application functionality. The application serves as an auction site that allows users to engage in auction activities, as well as for administrators to perform administrative functions. Main user activities include listing items, bidding on specific items, searching, and viewing auction results. Administrative operations include actions involving the alteration of user activities and auctions within the administrative scope. The application aims to provide users with a friendly interface, easy to navigate, while still adhering to business constraints regarding auctions. Below is the breakdown of the project phases with components:

- An Information Flow Diagram (IFD), which graphically represents how data flows within the database system between different components.
- An Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) diagram, which is used for conceptualizing and designing the database schema at a high level.
- A Relational Mapping Diagram, which defines mappings between classes and database tables, aiding in SQL generation.
- A task decomposition report, including data types, business constraints, and SQL queries for specific tasks.
